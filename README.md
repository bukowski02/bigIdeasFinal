#### Abstract:
Accidents are an unavoidable part of life that affect everybody in different ways, whether it be fires, traffic accidents, or a simple fall down the stairs. Accidents can change someone's life in an instant and therefore, are a highly important factor to consider when defining the best neighborhood. In this project, we will analyze the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh through the lens of accidents, measuring both accidents that have occurred and accidents that have the potential to occurr. Specifically, we will quantifying this by through the datasets  that track traffic accidents, fire incidents, ans steps.
